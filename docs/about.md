I am a Mom, athlete (running/snowboarding), avid baseball fan, continuous learner, and technology leader passionate about enabling greatness 

I find passion, excitement & value in connecting big picture strategy to the single Excel cell and inspire that sensibility in my team, by focus & refocusing them on how our work impacts strategy

I specialize in developing high performing teams that disrupt legacy processes by integrating digital experiences.
